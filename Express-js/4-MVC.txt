MVC stands for Model-View-Controller, and it's a software architectural pattern
commonly used in the development of web applications. The main idea behind MVC
is to separate the concerns of an application into three major components:

1. Model (M):
    The Model represents the application's data and business logic.
    It is responsible for managing and processing the data, as well
    as the rules and behaviors of the application.

2. View (V):
    The View is responsible for presenting the data to the user and receiving user input.
    It is the user interface (UI) that users interact with. Views display information
    from the Model and send user actions (such as clicks or inputs) to the Controller.

3. Controller (C):
    The Controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View.
    It receives user input from the View, processes that input (possibly by
    updating the Model), and updates the View accordingly. It manages the flow of data
    between the Model and the View.



The key principles of MVC are:

> Separation of Concerns: Each component (Model, View, Controller) has a distinct
role and responsibility, which makes the code more modular and maintainable.

> Scalability: Because of the separation of concerns, it is easier to scale and
modify different parts of the application independently.

> Reusability: Components can be reused in different parts of the application or even
in different applications, promoting code reusability.

> Testability: Each component can be tested independently, making it easier to identify
and fix issues.

MVC is commonly used in web development frameworks like Ruby on Rails, Django,
and Laravel, but the principles of MVC can be applied in various types of software development.


In an Express.js application, the directory and code structure often follow a common convention
to organize different components and modules. Here's a typical directory structure
for an Express.js application:

/project-root (or) model-view-controller
    ├── /node_modules      # Node.js modules installed via npm
    ├── /public            # Static files (stylesheets, images, etc.)
    ├── /views             # Views (templates for rendering HTML)
    ├── /routes            # Route handlers (controllers)
    ├── /models            # Data models
    ├── /controllers       # Controller logic
    ├── /middlewares       # Custom middleware functions
    ├── /config            # Configuration files
    ├── /utils             # Utility functions
    ├── /tests             # Unit and integration tests
    ├── app.js             # Main application file
    ├── package.json       # Node.js package configuration
    ├── package-lock.json  # Dependency lock file

  Explanation of key directories and files:

/public: Contains static assets such as stylesheets, images, and client-side JavaScript files.

/views: Holds template files (usually in a templating engine like EJS, Pug, or Handlebars) for rendering HTML.

/routes: Contains route handlers or controllers. Each file may handle routes for a specific resource or feature.

/models: Houses data models that represent entities in the application. These models interact with a database or other data source.

/controllers: Contains controller logic that handles business logic and orchestrates interactions between models and views.

/middlewares: Includes custom middleware functions. Middleware functions can perform tasks such as authentication, logging, etc.

/config: Holds configuration files for different environments (development, production, etc.).

/utils: Contains utility functions or helper modules used across the application.

/tests: Includes unit tests and integration tests for different parts of the application.

app.js: The main application file where you configure and start the Express.js application.

package.json and package-lock.json: Files that manage project dependencies and configurations.

This structure provides a clear separation of concerns and makes it easier to maintain and scale the application.
Keep in mind that the structure may be adapted based on project size, complexity, and specific requirements.
