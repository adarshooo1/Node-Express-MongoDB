Difference Between Node and Express

# Node.js: Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to execute JavaScript on the server side.
  It provides the basic infrastructure for building server-side applications but lacks a built-in framework
  for handling web-related tasks.

# Express: Express is a web application framework built on top of Node.js. It simplifies and streamlines
  the process of building web applications by providing a set of features and tools for handling routing, middleware,
  templates, and more.
